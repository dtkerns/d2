abstract = {Software is the basis of all applications. Whether for entertainment, gaming,
communications, or medicine, many of the products people use today began as a software
model or prototype. Based on the performance and programmability constraints of the
system, the software engineer is tasked with determining the best implementation platform
to get a project to market. To accomplish this task, the software engineer is aided by both
programming techniques and a variety of hardware processing platforms.}

abstract = {It is generally accepted that a custom hardware implementation of a set of computations will provide superior speed and energy efficiency relative to a software implementation. However, the cost and difficulty of hardware design is often prohibitive, and consequently, a software approach is used for most applications. In this article, we introduce a new high-level synthesis tool called LegUp that allows software techniques to be used for hardware design. LegUp accepts a standard C program as input and automatically compiles the program to a hybrid architecture containing an FPGA-based MIPS soft processor and custom hardware accelerators that communicate through a standard bus interface. In the hybrid processor/accelerator architecture, program segments that are unsuitable for hardware implementation can execute in software on the processor. LegUp can synthesize most of the C language to hardware, including fixed-sized multidimensional arrays, structs, global variables, and pointer arithmetic. Results show that the tool produces hardware solutions of comparable quality to a commercial high-level synthesis tool. We also give results demonstrating the ability of the tool to explore the hardware/software codesign space by varying the amount of a program that runs in software versus hardware. LegUp, along with a set of benchmark C programs, is open source and freely downloadable, providing a powerful platform that can be leveraged for new research on a wide range of high-level synthesis topics.},

abstract = {The gem5 simulation infrastructure is the merger of the best aspects of the M5 [4] and GEMS [9] simulators. M5 provides a highly configurable simulation framework, multiple ISAs, and diverse CPU models. GEMS complements these features with a detailed and exible memory system, including support for multiple cache coherence protocols and interconnect models. Currently, gem5 supports most commercial ISAs (ARM, ALPHA, MIPS, Power, SPARC, and x86), including booting Linux on three of them (ARM, ALPHA, and x86).The project is the result of the combined efforts of many academic and industrial institutions, including AMD, ARM, HP, MIPS, Princeton, MIT, and the Universities of Michigan, Texas, and Wisconsin. Over the past ten years, M5 and GEMS have been used in hundreds of publications and have been downloaded tens of thousands of times. The high level of collaboration on the gem5 project, combined with the previous success of the component parts and a liberal BSD-like license, make gem5 a valuable full-system simulation tool.},

This book is the definitive reference on C++ programming using STL, as it was written by the team that created the library. Every C++ programmer will need at least one off-the-shelf STL reference guide. Each chapter covers one STL component, and includes background, a review of the standard, using the component, implementing the component, and exercises.
